You have obtained a series of 1s and 0s. To get meaningful data out of this heap, retrieve every 10th bit in this series and and bring them together to form a string of 32 bits. The input data is present in the file 'file.txt'. Assume that the input file is entered via command line.
	Example:
		INPUT: 0101101111000110101011101100000000001110100010111010000010101011
		OUTPUT: 100000
