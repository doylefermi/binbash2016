The numbers you found were registered to places across the globe. The file 'file.txt' contains the 5 addresses. Your task is to find the latitude and longitude of each of these places and sum them up to get a new latitude and longitude. Next you must find the address corresponding to the newly obtained coordinates and print it out. Your script must work for any input file containing 5 addresses. Assume that the file is available as a command line argument.
Hint :  You may use Google Map API to get the coordinates and corresponding address.
  Note to use the long address field of the API return parameter to get exact address as shown in example below.  
Example:
    INPUT:
        Athens, Kentrikos Tomeas Athinon, Greece
  	Boksburg, Gauteng, South Africa
  	Canary Wharf, London, United Kingdom
  	Don Torcuato, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina
  	Laxmipur Pottangi Range, Kanaka, Odisha
    OUTPUT:
        Aktogay District, Karagandy Province, Kazakhstan, 100000\n
