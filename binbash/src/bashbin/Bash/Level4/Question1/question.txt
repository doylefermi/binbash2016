The text files containing some call logs are available at 'https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zsaljtt9blqy597/AADHNehVw_g5cWwrLc4QTjuna?dl=0'. The details are stored across multiple text files. Your task is to download all files(number not specified) available at 'https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zsaljtt9blqy597/AADHNehVw_g5cWwrLc4QTjuna?dl=0' and merge them into a single text file. The script must run for any folder publically shared in Dropbox. Assume that the URL is entered as a command line argument. 
Hint : Remember to supress stderr.
    Example:
        INPUT: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zsaljtt9blqy597/AADHNehVw_g5cWwrLc4QTjuna?dl=0
        OUTPUT: 
        	*Contents of file log1*
        	\n
        	*Contents of file log2*
        	\n
        	*Contents of file log3*
		\n
