The data still seems meaningless. Your task is to write a bash script that retrieves all the character that occurs after exactly 2 consecutive vowels. The resulting letters may form a meaningful word. The input may be found in the file 'file.txt'. Assume that the input file is available as a command line argument.
    Example:
        INPUT : adjdnaehskdsksiodsdnsoedjkneas
        OUTPUT :hdds
