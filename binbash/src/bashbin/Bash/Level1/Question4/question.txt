Your task is to compute the following function for any given positive number. The task should be implemented using a recursive function. The number must be entered as a command line argument.
	f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2, f(n) = f(n-1) * f(n-2)
	Example:
                INPUT: 4
                OUTPUT: 8
